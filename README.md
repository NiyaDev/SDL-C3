#### Info
- Functions are named like this: ```SDL_FunctionName``` -> ```sdl3::functionName``` or ```SDL_EGL_FunctionName``` -> ```sdl3::egl::functionName```.
- Typedefs, Structs, and Enums are translated as 1-to-1 as possible with Flag typedefs being converted to bitstructs where possible.
- SDL_stdinc.h is included despite being unnecessary.
